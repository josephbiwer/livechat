#Live Chat
Live chat application running on port 5050 on your local machine. You're more than welcome to host a server and point the socket in index.html to a specific device on the network, and then be able to chat across devices within your network.

#Installation
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Install the node module
    ```
      npm install
    ```
  3. Run the server
    ```
      node server
    ```
    
Your chat app is now up and running, just visit *localhost:5050* in your browser or *<device IP>:5050* if running on a seperate machine and broadcasting to your network.
